First make the meshes for each region (air, fuel, electrolyte, interconnect):

    cd air
    blockMesh
    cd ../fuel
    blockMesh
    <etc>

This will create "boundary" files in each region's constant/polyMesh directory. 
The "boundary" files must be edited to modify the specifications of the
coupled boundaries with respect to type, shadow region, shadow patch, and 
attached status.  Use the supplied "boundary.sav" files as a guide.
Take care to keep the face numbering generated by blockMesh in the "boundary"
file.


To run the model, type

    conjSofcFoam -case air

at the command line, or submit the runscript to your queue.


For postprocessing, edit the "linkTimeDirs" file for the time directories of interest and execute the file.  This will populate the fuel, electrolyte, and interconnect directories with links to their time directory output files. 
Then for each region (air, fuel, etc) type

    foamToVTK -case <region>

to get a VTK directory in each region, which can then be opened in paraview.
